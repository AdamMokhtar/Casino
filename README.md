# TCI Group 4 - Casino

We have created and tested an application to simulate real-time behaviours of a casino using a gambling authority API.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need

```

Java SDK 15,
IntelliJ

```

### Installing

Clone the git repository

```

git clone

```

Open the project in IntellJ and build the Gradle project

## Running the tests

Right click on the "test" folder, More Run/Debug, Run 'Tests in 'groupAssign...' with Coverage

Click 'Generate Coverage Report...' with the desired end folder, tick 'Open generated HTML in browser', and click Save

You will now be able to view the coverage of our tests and all tests should pass successfully.


### And coding style tests

We created tests based on application requirements which we split into test cases for Test Cherry to create for us.

We also worked using the TDD approach.
